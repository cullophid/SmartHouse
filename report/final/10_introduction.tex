In the recent years we have seen an increase in climate awareness. The subject is gaining more and more media coverage. A survey conducted from 2007 to 2008 by the international research organization Galllup\footnote{International research organization famous for making polls. http:/\slash ww.gallup.com
~\citep{gallup-2009}: http:/\slash www.gallup.com\slash poll\slash 124652\slash awareness-climate-change-threat-vary-region.aspx}, shows that 82\% of americans and 88\% of europeans are very aware of the current climate issues we are facing such as global warming. In the same survey Gallup also concludes that 67\% of americans and 59\% europeans view global warming as a serious threat to them selves and their families~\citep{gallup-2009}.
