## Analyses

* Identify the major problems that must be addressed by the project
	* Analyse project goals in the given context
	* Decompose the main problems into sub-problems
		* Propose possible solusions to sub-problems
		* compare and contrast proposed solutions
		* select "best" solutions to identified sub-problems
			* "Best" could be "fastests", "cheepest", "simplest", ...
* requiremetns specifiation is one result of this analysis
* analysis should be general
	* Should apply regardless of whether implementation is in hardware/software and regardless of programming language
