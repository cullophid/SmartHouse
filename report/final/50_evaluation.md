### Software testing

The implementation have been tested using a combination of white box and black box testing. 
<TODO bedre intro>

#### White box testing 

We have used JUnit tests to implement the white box testing. The relative simple Event classes, EventList and KeyList have been tested in this way. 

#### Black box testing

The more complex classes DecisionMatrix and Correlation are tested using black box testing, and are based on data generated by the simulator. The testing setup for the black box test black box test, consists of 6 sensors (1,2,3,7,8,9) and 3 switches (4,5,6). A simulated takes various paths to generate a representative sample of event patterns.

| Index | Description | Event sequence |
|:-----:|:------------|:--------------:|
| 1     | Path _A_, switch 4 on, sensor 9 | [1, 1&2, 2&3, 3, 4 on, 9] |
| 2     | Path _B_ then turns switch 5 off | [1&2, 5 off] |
| 3     | Path _B_ without using any switches | [1&2] |
| 4     | Path _C_, switch 6 on, sensor 7 | [2&3, 6 on, 7] |
| 5     | Path _C_ without using any switches | [2&3] |
| 6     | Path _C_, switch 6 on, sensor 8 | [2&3, 6 on, 8] | 
[Event patterns used for black box testing][bbox data]

Based on these simple event pattens, an accurate expected output can be determined for both the DecisionMatrix and Correlation. The expected output for the DecisionMatrix is based on the number of times each event pattern has been seen, and the number of times they have led to a switch event. Only patterns which leads to switch events are listed.

| Description | Sensor pattern | Switch | State | Probability |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|:------:|:-----:|:-----------:|
| without zone events |||||
| Path _A_ | [1, 1, 2, 2, 3] | 4 | on | 1 |
| Path _B_ | [1, 2] | 5 | off | 0.5 |
| Path _C_ | [2, 3] | 6 | on | 0.67 |
| with zone events |||||
| Path _A_ | [1, 1&2, 2&3] | 4 | on | 1 |
| Path _B_ | [1, 2] | 5 | off | 0.5 |
| Path _C_ | [2, 3] | 6 | on | 0.67 |
[DecisionMatrix's expected output][matrix expected]

Testing of the DecisionMatrix releaved what at first looked like an error. The probability for Path _C_ without zones had a probability of 100%, but with zones had the expected probability of 67%. Investigation revealed the cause was test case 5, where sensor 2 and 3 was triggered in the opposite order as test case 4 and 6. So while this error at first glace looked like a bug, is actually a feature, and one of the very reasons zone events were implemented. All other probabilities in the DecisionMatrix was as expected.

For the correlation table, the output is determined only by test cases where switches are turned on (1, 4 and 6). The expected output is:

| switches | sensors |||
|   | 7 | 8 | 9 |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 4 | 0 | 0 | 1 |
| 6 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 0 |
[Correlation table's expected output][corr expected]

The correlation table produced the expected results.

### Passive learning data

This section is going to evaluate how much the system have been able to learn, based on the data collected from the passive learning stage. In total 45.628 sensor events and 346 switch events was recorded. This is a very high sensor event to switch event ration, slight above 130 sensor events per switch event.

Of the 346 switch events, 194 was On events and 152 was Off events. If all switch event in a continuous period was recorded, the discrepency between on and off events would be atmost the number of actual switches. This could be due to lost Z-Wave messages, users forgetting to pressing the placebo switches. The system isn't dependant on the correct ordering of switch events, i.e. that On events are eventually always followed by an Off event, and vice versa. 

The discrepency between On and Off events, are an indicator that data have been lost, the system should still be able to learn based on the user data. The system will obviously not be able to learn based on the lost switch events. Assuming only switch events are lost, the missing switch events will also impact the system by having an increased sensor to switch event ratio, lowering the probabilities in the decision matrix.

The Correlation table isn't based on the entire data set of sensor events, but merely the interval after each On event. Therefor the sensor to switch event ratio for the Correlation table, isn't necesarily affected by missing switch events. 

#### Decision matrix

With the expectancy that the probabilitites are going to be relatively low, for each switch pattern, the evaluation of Decision Matrix will look at patterns detected more than how high or low the probability should be. The Decision Matrix will be evaluated for different configurations, to see which advantages or disadvantages each configuration has.

| Pattern | Probability | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:------------|
| 20 21 13 on | 0.57% | Moving in the hallway, and turning on the light in the Living room |
| 27 28 18 on | 0.75% | Moving in the bedroom, and turning on the light |
| 20 20 19 on | 2.38% | Moving in the hallway and turning on the light in the restroom |
| 20 21 19 on | 2.17% | |
| 21 20 19 on | 1.70% | |
| 21 25 17 on | 3.26% | Moving from the hallway into the kitchen and turning on the light |
| 20 25 17 on | 5.76% | |
| 20 20 19 off | 1.49% | Moving in the hallway turning off the light in the restroom |
| 21 20 19 off | 1.2% | |
| 20 21 19 off | 1.14% | |
[Decision matrix, patterns detected atleast 5 times, pattern length 2, without zone detection][decision2false]

With pattern length two, most of the patterns, above the confidence limit, only contain sensor event from a single room (from here on refered to as single room patterns). With the probabilities being as low as they are, it means the single room patterns get triggered a lot, without the light being switched on or off. This means if the system were to act based on these single room patterns, it would mostly likely turn the lights on and off, while the user were still in the room.

There are only two pattern where sensor events are from different room (from here on refered to as multi room patterns): [20, 25 -> 17 on] and [21, 25 -> 17 on]. These two patterns occur when the user moves from the hallway and into the kitchen, and then turns on the light in the kitchen. These two multi room patterns, not only sound reasonable, but also have the highest probabilies of all the patterns above the confidence limit. 

With pattern length two, and zone detection enabled, no event patterns with zones (from here on referd to as zone patterns) are seen leading to switch events 5 times or more. So for pattern length two, adding zones detection doesn't give any patterns above the confidence limit, for our data set. While zone events can reduce the ambiguity and allow the system to learn faster, physical motion sensors tends to have a cooldown. Cooldown means it takes some time, after the sensor has detected motion, before it will detect motion again. A result of this is that zone events are less likely to be detected. Two sensors might overlap, but if time between the two sensors are triggered are longer than the zone detection interval. The cooldown then cause the two sensors to keep firing sensor events too far apart to be detected as zone events.  

| Pattern | Probability | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:------------|
| 27 27 28 18 on | 1.86% | Moving in the bedroom, and turning on the light |
| 20 21 20 19 on | 2.35% | Moving in the hallway, and turning on the light in the restroom |
| 21 20 21 19 on | 2.03% | 
| 29 21 20 19 off | 10.2% | Moving from the restroom to the hallway, turning off the light in the restroom |
| 21 20 21 19 off | 2.36% | Moving in the hallway, turning off the light in the restroom |
[Decision matrix, patterns detected atleast 5 times, pattern length 3, without zone detection][decision3false]

When the pattern length is increased to three, fewer distinct switch patterns above the confidence limit are detected. Just as when the pattern length was two, the majority of the patterns are single room patterns. There is one multi room pattern: [29, 21, 10 -> 19 off] where the user leaves the restroom, enters the hallway and turns off the light to the restroom. Like the other two multi room patterns, this pattern sounds reasonable, and have a relatively high probility of just over 10%.

Again adding zone detection doesn't prododuce any zone patterns above the confidence threshold .

| Pattern | Probability | Description |
|:-------:|:-----------:|:------------|
| 28 27 21 20 19on | 8.33% | Moving from the bedroom to the hallway, turning on the light in the restroom |
| 29 29 21 20 19 off | 11.11% | Moving from the restroom the the hallway, turning off the light in the restroom |
| -1 21 20 21 19 off | 9.38% | Moving in the hallway, turning off the light in the restroom |
[Decision matrix, patterns detected atleast 3 times, pattern length 4, without zone detection][decision4false]

Increasing the pattern length to 4, no patterns were above the confidence limit of 5, so these patterns have only been see 3 or more times. This matrix have an interesting multi room pattern [28, 27, 21, 20 -> 19 on], where the user moves from the bedroom to the hallway, and then turn on the light to the restroom. While a plausable pattern, it isn't a pattern that can be guaranteed to always happen. 

The previous multi room patterns were pattern that would close to always be correct, turning on the light when entering the kitchen, and turning off the light when leaving the restroom. But going from the bedroom to the hallways, is not a guarantee that the user needs light on in the restroom.

<TODO move decision matrix meta data up>
In order to better evaluate the Decision Matrix, it have been run on the training several times, with different pattern lengths, with and without zone detection. The evaluation will look upon the advantages and disadvantages the different configurations, and

[Statistics about the Decision matrix][dtable metadata]

With zones enabled, the system looks at the event patterns leading up to each switch event, with and without zone detection. Detecting up to two switch patterns for every switch event, in some configurations there are more total switch patterns detected than actual switch events. A complete dump of all patterns detected by the Decision Matrix for each configuration is included in the appendix.

With a 130 to 1 sensor to switch event ratio, the probabilities for each event pattern leading to a switch event is very low. This isn't necesarily a problem, it may just mean the probability threshold, for the system to be confident enough to manipulate switches, needs to be equally low. 

A lot of the On / Off patterns detected by the Decision Matrix have only been observed once. We're going to set the confindence threshold so that a pattern must have lead to an On or Off event atleast 5 times, and then analyse the correctness of the patterns observed

#### Correlation

In this section we are going to evaluate how well correlation, based on the generated user data, matches to the actual setup. Is the system able to get accurate estimates of which sensors and switches are in the same room. We are also going to evaluate how well the correlation based timeout would work, with or without correlation corrections. Prior to looking at the actual data, we want to state some resoanable goals we want the system to achieve for the correlation probabilities:

1. A sensor should have the highest correlation to the switch in the room it is in.
2. Some correlation threshold should exist, so that sensors and switches in the same room are above the threshold, and those not in the same room are below the threshold.

[Correlation table, based on statistical data. > 40% in bold, 40-20% in italic.][ctable data] 

The [correlation table][ctable data] is based on collected data from the testing environment. The first criteria holds, that all sensors have the highest correlation with the switch in the room they are in. 
The send criteria does not hold for all correlations. Most correlation probability for sensors and switches in the same room are above 40%. All correlations for switches and sensors not in the same room are below 40%. But three sensors have correlations lower than 40% to the switch in the room they are in, and one of them as low as 12%. In the living room, two sensors not only have correlations below 40%, but correlations below those of sensors in the adjecent hallway. 

As can be seen in [the overview of the appartment](#Hellebaekgade), the sensors 22 and 25 are located in the far end of the rooms from the switch and doorway. Since the calculated correlation probabilities are based on the time interval just after the light is turned on, it makes sense that these sensor, being relatively far away from the switches ends up with a lower correlation. 

[Hellebaekgade]: figures/hellebaekgade3.png "Hellebaekgade image"

Sensor 23 is positioned to monitor the sofa in front of the TV, and the data suggest that it only detect the user if he go to the sofa immediately after he enters the room. So not all sensors neccesarily trigger in a room, depending on what the user decides to do in the room. 

So in this case, the correlation still gives an excelent estimate of which switches and sensors are in the same room, by looking switch each sensor has the highest correlation probability too. 

One thing to note is, these are the probabilities based solely on the statistical data, and that correlation corretions would be added onto this schema. So it is not a perfect reflect of which sensors are in the same room each switch, on it is own. But it does gives a good approximation.

#### Correlation based timeout

The implemented functionality of the correlation table, is to determine the timeout for each switch. How well is the correlation table able to keep the light on where it's needed. Different areas should have different timeouts, but most important is for the system to have long timeouts in areas where the user is likely to be still for extended periods of time, while still wanting the light to remain on. The most obvious area would be the sofa, where a user is likely to be for hours. Based on passive learning data, the system would have one of the lowest timeouts when the user is detected in the sofa, where it should be the highest. 

However with active learning the correlation correction comes into effect. Every time the system incorrectly turns off the light, and the user turns it on again, the system is punished and increases the correlation, and by extension the timeout. As a result of this, the system will gradually increase the timeout until it no longer turns off the light, while the user is watching TV.
