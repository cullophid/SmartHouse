## Introduction

In the recent years we have seen an increase in climate awareness. Environmental issues such as global warming, are widely debated both on a political and personal level, and the subject is gaining increased media coverage. A survey conducted from 2007 to 2008 by the international research organization Galllup[^gallup] shows that 82% of americans and 88% of europeans are very aware of the current climate issues we are facing[gallup-2009][#gallup-2009]. In the same survey Gallup also concludes, that 67% of americans and 59% europeans view global warming as a serious threat to them selves and their families. With the rise of concern with the general public, the demand for sustainable solutions increases. We are already seeing a large number of companies, spending a considerable amount of money to be classified as environmentally conscious. Companies such as Amazon are spending millions of dollars on sustainable buildings, in order to maintain an image as an environmentally conscious company. 

In the residential sector the environmental awareness id equally present, but the so called "green wave"[^green wave] has not had nearly the same commercial impact. This is however not due to lack of potential. According to the United States Energy Information Administration[^eia],  the residential sector constituted 22% of the total energy consumption in the US[eia-2011][#eia-2011]. The main problem in this sector is financial. Improving your residence to be more environmentally friendly is costly, and though most improvements generally pay for them selves over time, the return of investment will often take several years. This problem is not nearly as big in the business sector, where the gain in public image can be very valuable, and may even be worth the investment in it self. In the residential sector, however, the financial benefits of installing environmentally friendly technology solely come from the reduction in energy consumption.

There is a lot of focus on saving energy by changing habits, such as remembering to turn off the light on the bathroom, or not using the standby feature on many appliances. All these initiatives certainly help, but if we want to make a significant reduction in our energy consumption we need smart environments[^smart-envirionments], that are capable of micro managing our energy use. 

The idea of smart environments is a product of the concept ubiquitous computing[^ubiquitous computing], a term invented by the late computer scientist Mark Weiser[^weiser]. Weisier coined the term while working  as chief technologist at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)[^parc]. Ubiquitous computing proposes a new paradigm in human-computer interaction, where the role of the computer is to serve the users, rather than act as a tool that requires direct interaction. Smart environments fulfill this role, by monitoring its users, and acting on their behalf, without the need of their active participance.  It is described by Mark Weiser as:

_"a physical world that is richly and invisibly interwoven with sensors, actuators, displays, and computational elements, embedded seamlessly in the everyday objects of our lives, and connected through a continuous network"_  -Mark Weiser

The concept of smart environments originated in 1988, but in the recent years we have seen a large development in this field. This in mainly due to the development in computing power, and availability of embedded systems, which lies at the heart of the smart environments.

The purpose of this thesis is to explore the possibilities of developing a low cost intelligent home control system, capable of reducing the power consumption in normal households. This control system will be based on the core concepts of smart environments. The thesis will serve as a research paper on the possibilities of using machine learning[^machine-learning] algorithms to develop an advanced artificial intelligence, capable of controlling a house hold, and reducing power consumption.  We have created a prototype of a smart environment, that serves as a proof of concept, and can be used as the basis for further development. The final product shows the power of ubiquity computing, as a means of reducing energy consumption in the normal household.

The thesis will focus solely on lighting control in the smart environment. This allows us to focus on the integration of machine learning, rather than adding a large array of functionality. The advantage of focussing on lighting compared to other aspects, is that we are provided instant visual feedback when manipulating the environment.This will prove very useful for development and testing purposes. The core concepts of controlling the light will be similar to many of the other task that can be handled by a smart environment, therefore the solutions developed as a result of the work done in this thesis, will be transferable to other areas, such as heating regulation, air-conditioning, etc.

The thesis is structured as follows:

In the chapter "Analysis" we will identify and analyze the problems and issues, related to developing an intelligent home control system. This involves analyzing existing solutions and technologies related to the technological field of smart environments.

In the chapter "Design" we will discuss our solutions to the problems identified in the analysis. We will also briefly present the development process, and how this have affected the final product. This chapter will also hold a theory section, where we will discuss the most important technologies we have used, along with the mathematical theory that forms the basis for our solution.

The "Implementation" chapter examines the transition from a software blueprint to working code. In the chapter, we will in detail describe the problems we had to solve when coding the system.

Finally we will evaluate the results of our research in the chapter "Evaluation". The chapter will both evaluate our solution and contain a description of the software tests we have performed on the system.
