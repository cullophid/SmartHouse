In the recent years we have seen an increase in climate awareness. The subject is gaining more and more media coverage. A survey conducted from 2007 to 2008 by the international research organization Galllup[^gallup], shows that 82% of americans and 88% of europeans are very aware of the current climate issues we are facing such as global warming. In the same survey Gallup also concludes that 67% of americans and 59% europeans view global warming as a serious threat to them selves and their families[gallup-2009][#gallup-2009]. With the rise of concern with the general public, the demand for sustainable solutions increases. 
According to the United States Energy Information Administration[^eia],  the residential constituted 22% of the total energy consumption in the US[eia-2011][#eia-2011].
