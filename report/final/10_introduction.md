In the recent years we have seen an increase in climate awareness. The subject is gaining more and more media coverage. A survey conducted from 2007 to 2008 by the international research organization Galllup[^gallup], shows that 82% of americans and 88% of europeans are very aware of the current climate issues we are facing such as global warming. In the same survey Gallup also concludes that 67% of americans and 59% europeans view global warming as a serious threat to them selves and their families[#gallup-climate].
