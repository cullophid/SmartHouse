## Introduction

this is the the intro baby

### Scope

__Define Context__

* Present the domain of the project
  * From he general to the specific
    * Distributed systems -> wireless -> ubiquitous computing
    * Include references to demonstrate you know the domain
* Identify important properties of the project domain
  * What makes this project domain special?
    * Why do we need to undertake this project
* Define the scope of the project
  * what sub-problems will be considered
  * what sub-problems will _not_ be considered

### Goals

__Identify Goals__

* Project goals
  * What are the main problems that the project should solve?
* Non-functional requirements
  * Usability, performance, flexibility, extensibility, simplicity, security...
* Non-project goals
  * experiments with (specific) new technology
  * personal development

__short answers__

* Project goals
    * Create a home control system that relies on machine learning instead of programmability.
* Non-functional requirements
  * Usability, performance, flexibility, extensibility, simplicity, security...
* Non-project goals
    * examine the possibilities of a system with minimal knowledge about its operating environment.
    * examine the possibilities of a system with minimal setup, and programming required




### writing a good introduction

* what is the problem
    - explain the context of the project and identify goals
* what is the proposed solution?
    - Analyse problems and present proposed solution
* How do we evaluate the proposed solution?
    - Present evaluation criteria for proposed solution
    - define the method and scope of the project
* What did we learn?
    - Present a summary of the overall conclusions
    - lure the reader into reading the rest of the report

We want to create an intelligent smarthouse system, with a minimal setup requirement, to control the lighting. A system which after switches and sensors are physically installed, doesn't require further setup or technical expertise from the user. The system shouldn't require any direct user interaction.

The system should be able to gradutally take over turning on and off the light. It should learn solely based on the user's normal behavoid, which patterns leads up to turning the light on or off, for how long should the light stay on. 

Ideally this should lead to increased comfort for the users, by not having to manually control the light. Possebly also reduced energy consumption, by only having light on when the users need it. Also by being more active about turning light off where it isn't needed, where most users wouldn't bother to get up to turn it off.
