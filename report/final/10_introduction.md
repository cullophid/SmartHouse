## Introduction

this is the the intro baby

### Scope

__Define Context__

* Present the domain of the project
  * From he general to the specific
    * Distributed systems -> wireless -> ubiquitous computing
    * Include references to demonstrate you know the domain
* Identify important properties of the project domain
  * What makes this project domain special?
    * Why do we need to undertake this project
* Define the scope of the project
  * what sub-problems will be considered
  * what sub-problems will _not_ be considered

### Goals

__Identify Goals__

* Project goals
  * What are the main problems that the project should solve?
* Non-functional requirements
  * Usability, performance, flexibility, extensibility, simplicity, security...
* Non-project goals
  * experiemtns with (specific) new technology
  * personal development

__short answers__

* Project goals
    * Create a home control system that relies on machine learning instead of programmability.
* Non-functional requirements
  * Usability, performance, flexibility, extensibility, simplicity, security...
* Non-project goals
    * examine the possibilities of a system with minimal knowledge about its operating environment.
    * examine the possibilities of a system with minimal setup, and programming required




### writing a good introduction
